								<b> Phylogeography and Population Genetics of <i>Saccharomyces paradoxus</i> </b><br>One of the species I study in my research is a woodland yeast known as <i>S. paradoxus</i>. Our lab has made some surprising discoveries about the range of this species in North America. With the addition of 44 new North American and 46 new European whole genomes, our lab was able to detect novel signatures of evolution within <i>S. paradoxus</i> lineages.

								<b>Improving isolation of pathogenic yeast from the environment</b><br> Another aim of my PhD is to improve the isolation of pathogenic yeast from environmental sources. With funding from the NIH T32 Genetics Training grant I experimented with different types of enrichment media, incubation temperatures, and plate media in an attempt to target pathogens from environmental samples.
